# Ev_adoption

This project explores the adoption trends of electric vehicles (EVs) using real-world population data.
It provides insights into how EV usage has evolved over time, which regions lead adoption, and which manufacturers dominate the EV market.
The notebook performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on EV population data, covering:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values and standardizing fields

EV Adoption Trends: Tracking the rise in EV registrations by model year

Geographical Insights: Identifying top counties and states driving EV growth

Brand Analysis: Comparing popular EV manufacturers and models

Visualization: Using Python libraries to create clear, interactive insights
